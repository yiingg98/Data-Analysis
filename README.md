# Data Analysis Portfolio  

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects showcasing work in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and generating actionable insights using Python.  

Each project explores a dataset, identifies patterns and trends, and summarizes key findings. The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills that are valuable in business and research contexts.  


## Projects  

### Titanic Survival EDA  
**Objective:** Explore the Titanic dataset to analyze survival rates based on passenger characteristics.  
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values.  
- Conducted univariate and bivariate exploration.  
- Visualized distributions of age, gender, class, and fare.  
- Correlation analysis to identify significant variables.  
- **Key Insights:** Survival rates were higher for females, children, and first-class passengers.  

**Files:**  
- `TitanicEDA/titanic_eda.ipynb` – Notebook with full analysis.  
- `TitanicEDA/train.csv` – Dataset.  



### Sales and Customer Analytics  
**Objective:** Analyze sales and customer data to understand performance and behavior.  
- Cleaned and structured raw sales data.  
- Performed univariate analysis on sales values and product categories.  
- Sales trends over time (monthly and quarterly patterns).  
- Identified top-selling products, key customer groups, and city-level sales.  
- Exported cleaned dataset and reports to Excel.  
- Designed an optional Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization.  

**Files:**  
- `SalesAnalytics/sales_eda.ipynb` – Notebook with analysis.  
- `SalesAnalytics/data/sales_data.csv` – Dataset (sample or real).  
- `SalesAnalytics/output/` – Exported Excel and results.  



## Tools and Technologies  

- **Languages:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git, GitHub  
- **Dashboard (optional):** Streamlit  
- **Data Sources:** Kaggle datasets, Google Dataset Search, and simulated data  



## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
